<h2> Working with regular expressions</h2>
<p>Purpose of this lesson is to see how regular expressions can be used to validate input and find general patterns within a given string</p>
<p>Input is sent with a form of this document to a php file, where the string is processed</p>
<!-- TODO: Create a HTML <form> with a <textarea>, a <label> and a <button> element for entering  and submitting long text -->
<!-- TODO: Use the necessary <form> attributes to call a PHP file moneycounter.php where the text is processed and analyzed for amounts of money with a POST-Request -->
<!-- TODO: Use the necessary attributes for <textarea>,  for input to appear in $_POST and connect <textarea> with <label>. Format the size of the <textarea> with the attributes "rows" and "cols" to see whole textsnippet -->
<!-- TODO: Use the text snippet in teststring.txt to test your regex. It shows all valid and invalid test cases and should sum up to 1000 EUR -->
<!-- Optional: Need a more challenging Regex? Use challenge.txt for a more complex example, also summing up to 1000 EUR -->
